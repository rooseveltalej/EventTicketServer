# EventTicketServer - ITCR Programming Languages Course Project (2024)

This repository contains the server-side implementation for a simulated event ticket purchasing system, developed as part of the Programming Languages course at the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (ITCR) during the second semester of 2024. The project is implemented using Rust, focusing on high performance, concurrency, and secure coding practices.

### Project Details:

- Course: Programming Languages (2024)
- Institution: Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica (ITCR)
- Duration: 15 days
- Technology: Rust
- Scope: Simulate a server for managing event ticket purchases, including handling user accounts, event listings, and transaction processing. 
- Client: The client-side of the project will be developed in a separate repository.
- Test Application: A preliminary test application will be developed in Python as the first deliverable to demonstrate initial functionality and serve as a proof of concept.

This project aims to demonstrate the application of Rust in building robust and efficient backend systems, while adhering to the principles taught in the course.
